#### Day 1 (February 8th, 2021): Welcome to SureStart!
##### Reflect on what you hope to learn in this program

As a senior poised to graduate from college, I have enjoyed my AI classes and want to dive deeper into the application of these ideas. I have coded many of these types of networks from scratch and am interested in becoming more familiar with ML libraries beyond NumPy, as they are useful in real-world contexts. I'd love to finish this program armed with deeper knowledge of various concepts and architectures, which will hopefully translate into applicable skills so I can get a job in a field I am interested in!

I'm especially excited for the Makeathon because I want to not only learn but develop real solutions to meaningful problems.

#### Day 2 (February 9th, 2021): Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) AND Scikit-learn
##### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 

Supervised learning is trained on labeled examples, with expected outputs, whereas unsupervised learning aims to find patterns within data without pre-defined relationships between input and output.

##### Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
As a ML library, Scikit-learn is concerned with data modeling, not with visualization or display. These other libraries are able to bridge the gap and serve as a visualization interface for models and data.

#### Day 3 (February 10th, 2021):

##### What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning? 
Tensors are multidimensional arrays that are generalizations of vecotrs matrixes etc. They are used to store data for ML and can be manipulated with various mathematical operations.

##### What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?
I noticed that a lot of the math is hidden behind tensorflow so if you're not careful, you might not actually know what you're doing.

#### Day 9 (February 16th, 2021): ALGORITHMIC BIAS AND DATA SETS
##### How do you think Machine Learning or AI concepts were utilized in the design of this game?
The game was really interesting because it showed just how innocently bias can appear in ML models. Since they reflect back the patterns they see in data, latent relationships that are actually not important are mimiced and perpretuated. 

##### Can you give a real-world example of a biased machine learning model, and share your ideas on how you make this model more fair, inclusive, and equitable? Please reflect on why you selected this specific biased model.
I'd say that most models that make judgements on humans are likely to biased. With facial recognition and classification software that has been trained to identify gender of faces, there is potential for bias both racial, as they can be less accurate on darker skinned people, and gender discrimination, especially as it pertains to gender non-conformity. The first problem could be helped with more data, and more a equally distributed training set. This could help with the second as well, but it also brings up the question of if we should even be creating certain models in the first place. It's possible and even likely that for many queer people, these models will never approach fairness because for many people (percieved) gender and appearance are not congruous.
