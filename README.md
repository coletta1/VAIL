-reflect on what you hope to learn in this program

As a senior poised to graduate from college, I have enjoyed my AI classes and want to dive deeper into the application of these ideas. I'd love to finish this program armed with deeper knowledge of various concepts and architectures, which will hopefully translate into applicable skills so I can get a job in a field I am interested in!

I'm especially excited for the makeathon because I want to not only learn but develop real solutions to meaningful problems.
