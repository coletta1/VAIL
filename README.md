#### Day 1 (February 8th, 2021): Welcome to SureStart!
##### Reflect on what you hope to learn in this program

As a senior poised to graduate from college, I have enjoyed my AI classes and want to dive deeper into the application of these ideas. I have coded many of these types of networks from scratch and am interested in becoming more familiar with ML libraries beyond NumPy, as they are useful in real-world contexts. I'd love to finish this program armed with deeper knowledge of various concepts and architectures, which will hopefully translate into applicable skills so I can get a job in a field I am interested in!

I'm especially excited for the Makeathon because I want to not only learn but develop real solutions to meaningful problems.

#### Day 2 (February 9th, 2021): Introduction to Machine Learning (ML) AND Scikit-learn
##### What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? 

Supervised learning is trained on labeled examples, with expected outputs, whereas unsupervised learning aims to find patterns within data without pre-defined relationships between input and output.

##### Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.
As a ML library, Scikit-learn is concerned with data modeling, not with visualization or display. These other libraries are able to bridge the gap and serve as a visualization interface for models and data.
